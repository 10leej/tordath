# Welcome to The World of Tor'Dath
Hi I'm Josh I'm writing this setting as I progress through my campaign. So I suggest you bookmark [this page](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/-m-ibxHg) and look for updates fairly often.  
If you're curious on the campaign specifics. It's a homebrew inspired by [Matt Colville's](https://www.youtube.com/user/mcolville) *Running the Game* series and as such you'll see some references.

## The World
Tor'Dath is a world gripped by political tensions, rising cult activities, and potentially dangerous secrets. From fallen ancient kingdoms, to many various mysteries I personally hope whoever decides to run this setting has much fun as I do.  
This guide as is, is fairly minimal and that is because Tor'Dath is a player driven world. As such you won't find a single map here (yet), nor a lot of detail in general. As such its a great base for a DM who wan't to homebrew a new setting and modify it to his/her hearts contempt.

## The Content
This campaign setting was written with the inclusion of Critical Role content, and Eberron's Artificer class. Outside of that you'll want the Core Rule books, and Volo's Guide to Monsters.  
You'll also want to include optional firearm rules in the Dungeon Matser's Guide (page 267) using just the Rennaisance weapons.  
Airships do exist but are rare and require a crew of artificers to keep aloft due to their unreliability. (more details coming later)

## Running a D&D Campaign
I admit, this as is, is not a complete guide. Thats why I said you should bookmark it. As is you'll have to come up with the history of the world though I do have some general guidelines for the history laid out. I'll be updating this document with the history of the world [soon](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=soon)  

## Future Plans
Eventually I'll release a more detailed version and possibly some optional class options specific to the Tor'Dath Campaign Setting. I might even publish some of the adventures I plan to run out of here, who knows.

# Pantheon
The gods of Tor'Dath are often not referred to by their direct name, but rather they often referred to in descriptive nicknames or aliases. You'll see the most common names listed.  
The gods are distant from Tor'Dath but they don't leave the planet abandoned, instead they may go only as far as the smallest influence on the world. That said there have been times before where mortal's have ascended to godhood, or even gods have fallen.  
Malliel stands atop as the lone Head of the Pantheon while the rest serve as his advisors.

This section might get greatly expanded upon.

Legend says Delios was once a great nation that united all the lands of Tor'Dath. That was said to be the Kingdom of the Gods founded by Maliel himself.  
Delios does still exist as a nation, though it's much smaller and exists South of the larger Taran Empire.

Much like Stroth however, Tothwescom's closest form of government is comprised of various tribes though they seem much less likely to cooperate and focus more of their spiritual worship and survival.  
The city of Camor sits deep in the moutains far from the prying eyes of Limbuld and is the home of the Order of Storms

# Races
Tor'Dath is home to all the races found in every published content for your RPG, though this setting was designed for a D&D 5e campaign in particular. It's not exactly difficult to find a place for each race and there really aren't any new races intended for Tor'Dath at this time. As this campaign setting expands this may be subject to change.

## The Common Races
You find these races with a sizable population in most every nation and they are generally accepted by the masses.

### Dwarves
Dwarves are more numerous in the southern mountain regions of the eastern continent, but are still a fairly common sight.

### Elves
There is rarely a forest without an elf, though they often tend to seclude themselves to the said forests it’s not unusual to see them out in the world as well. They are most numerous in the forests of Elvaria and Pelechinia.

### Halflings
Half hail from Bevelinar. They’ve even taken up as a rather wealthy seafaring race in the past couple hundred years and have become a fairly common sight among the sailors of Tor'Dath.

### Humans
Humans are the most numerous race in the lands, there is barely a nation or land that does not have at least a medium portion of humans in it’s population.

## The Uncommon Races
Just a note, in some parts of the world members of these races are treated very unfriendly, or even potentially hunted down.  
*Monstrous Races from Volo's Guide to monsters are allowed though may not be referenced in this guide*

### Goliaths
All Goliaths call Tothwescom home even if they’ve never been there. You’ll often find the Goliath tribes in the tallest and coldest of mountain ranges.

### Half-Elves
Half-Elves are born from a human and elf parent and are often treated fairly better than most of the other uncommon races, but to a human they look like elves. And, to elves they look like humans. This leads many half-elves to live a secluded life.

### Half-Orcs
Often born to a human and orc parents the Half-Orcs are treated well for Orcs, but not so well the humans of the kingdoms. Thus you’ll only really see a sizable population in Stroth living among the barbaric orc tribes or the more shamanist tribes of the Stroth.

### Kenku
Kenku are a cursed race of ancient Chernians where they ruled over a vast empire that collapsed thousands of years ago and is mostly forgetten in mortal memory. At least for those that are not among the Kenku. Today you'll see the Kenku most often in the Taran Empire near their ancient homeland

### Orc
Often living in tribes Orc are the most numerous of the uncommon races, though when you see one outside of Tothwescom or Stroth it’s because the tribe lost it’s territory to another.

### Tabaxi
The Tabaxi hail from Bevelinar and much like Halflings sail on the high seas trading with the various nations.

### Tiefling
Often mistaken the demons the Tiefling’s of Tor’Dath actually are suprisingly more related to the Yaun-Ti than humans, though no one is truly sure of the Tiefling race’s origin. It’s not so uncommon to see a Tiefling outside of Medbia or the Taran Empire, but even then it’s rare enough that many people might only ever meet a single one even among the Tiefling themselves.

### Triton
Hailing exclusively from the seafaring nation of Pilto the Triton are a very isolationist society. As a result many areas might not have seen a Triton for generations let alone even believe they actually exist.

# Classes
## Artificer
True Artificer's are fairly rare due to the newer advances in the arcane sciences. Most of the artificers you'll find are based in the Limbuldian City of Vass, or Service the guilds in the Taipan Union or Bevelinar.

## Barbarian
Barbarian's are often coming from the tribal lands of Tothwescom and Stroth. Surviving the harsh shamanist lands they're used to rough weather, cold winters, and don't usually trust the magics of Wizards, Clerics, Artificers, or Bards

## Bard
Bards exist and use magic with their performances, some are more practiced in forms of combat, but usually only for show purposes. Most general bards come from the great cities of Vass, Cen'Rass, Bevelinar, and the Taipan Union

## Blood Hunter
[Blood Hunters](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/301641/Blood-Hunter-Class-for-DD-5e-2020) are usually followers of Rapha who are willing to sacrifice everything to fight their enemies. They often are not welcomed by those more practiced in the magical arts as the magic they practice is usually linked with vampirism.

## Cleric
*(Note for DMs, I allow the use of Blood Clerics from the Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting)*  
Clerics serve many roles in Tor'Dath, while they aren't always aligned with a specific organization you'll see clerics far and wide across the lands. Clerics draw their power mostly much the same way Wizards do. But, they shape their magics to follow the domains of their church. This means a cleric will never really change their domain due to devine influence and if they do they must take the time to learn the new magics.

## Druid
Druids are often found in isolated groups or conclaves and don't align with a god usually. Though when they do they often follow Richa or Idring. Druids typically live in enclaves scatterred throughout the lands and have younger members go on great pilgrimmages to learn the ways of the world.

## Fighter
Fighters are everywhere as a staple of Fantasy worlds you'll see fights from every race. They serve as guards, gladiators, hunters, what have you. The [Gunsligner Martial Archetype](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/170778/Gunslinger-Martial-Archetype-for-Fighters) written by Mathew Mercer is recommended though I admit I don't have a player running it.

## Monk
Monks are often followers of Maliel and live in the various monasteries practicing his teachings. You'll often see Monks go on pilgrimages to learn the methods of the world. Or even act as sages for organizations of such *Historica Ordinis*

## Paladin
Paladin's on Tor'Dath do not gain their powers from gods unlike some worlds, instead their power stems from the Oaths they have taken and the ancient magics behind them. That said a paladin who takes no oath is powerless, while the Oathbreaker paladin stands as a paladin who has broken an aspect of his oath. Over the course of a paladin's life it's not unusual for his powers to change based upon the oaths he has taken.

## Ranger
Rangers are often found exploring the various lands hunting game, or just serving on expeditions. Often they've adapted their own forms of magics through self learning to adapt to their surrounds, or even the prey they seek to hunt.

## Rogue
Rogues often operate as thieves or assasins either for hire, or out of necessity. Or even for the thrill of it.

## Sorceror
Sorcerors are often either revered for their raw power, or feared because of it by the various practicioners in the magical arts of the lands. Many sorcorer's go on great journeys to learn to control their powers whether they be gained from exterior sources such as exposure to the raw magic of the leylines, the demonic magics of the demons, or even the blood of dragons. Sorcerors on Tor'Dath don't just happen to be born with these powers and those powers will always have a source. Whether they want to seek it out, or not.

## Warlock
Warlocks due to how they gain their power are often shunned or even criminalized in some areas. That said with the direct absence of the gods the powers of demonic influence are made more apparent, and warlocks gain there powers through the contracts and pacts signed with fiends, celestials, or even ancient beings of great power.

## Wizard
Wizards are the trained magicians and the most common practiciners of the lands. They even have their own city in Vass located within the northern area of the Kingdom of Limbuld. With patience and a bit of practice via practical means Wizards have been know to raid fire from the skies, or even bend time and reality to their will.
