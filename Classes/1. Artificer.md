# Artificer
With the invention of the *Mythallar* and it's wonderous capability of storing mana, the artificer became a profession worthy of the same respect as those of the Wizardry, and respected like the Sorceror.  
While not traditional spellcasters Artificers use their wonderous inventions to channel the magical powers that be. That said while Artificers are a known quantity the devices they carry hold a lot of value. If not monetarily, then the scientific advancements the Artificer made to create the item would seek the eye's of many.
