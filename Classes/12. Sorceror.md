# Sorceror
Sorcerors are often either revered for their raw power, or feared because of it by the various practicioners in the magical arts of the lands. Many sorcorer's go on great journeys to learn to control their powers whether they be gained from exterior sources such as exposure to the raw magic of the leylines, the demonic magics of the demons, or even the blood of dragons. Sorcerors on Tor'Dath don't just happen to be born with these powers and those powers will always have a source. Whether they want to seek it out, or not.
