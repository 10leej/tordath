# Paladin
Paladin's on Tor'Dath are trained soldiers and knight who draw their magical powers from the Oaths they have sworn and the ancient magics behind them. No one truely knows who created the magical circuit or why it's tied to an Oath, but the power is undeniable for those who can take the time to learn and abide by them. The strict tenants of the various oaths are more than just words, but a true way of life. That said it's not unusual for a Paladin to live with one of the various Orders from a very young age. Sometimes by the choice of family, othertimes to avoid a life of poverty.  
The Oathbreaker on Tor'Dath only operates on his residial powers and will need to swear a new Oath or eventually lose all his/her powers.
