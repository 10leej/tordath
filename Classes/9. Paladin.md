# Paladin
Paladin's on Tor'Dath are trained soldiers and knight who draw their magical powers from the Oaths they have sworn and the ancient magics behind them. No one truly knows who created the magical circuit or why it's tied to an Oath, but the power is undeniable for those who can take the time to learn and abide by them.  
The strict tenants of the various oaths are more than just words, but a true way of life. A paladin is most often a member of an order of knights in the service of one of the many temples, or kingdoms. A paladin is often tasked with being a peacekeeper as well and often could serve in an enforcement role.  
## *The Ritual of Swearing Oaths*
Paladins get their power form the magic of their Oath, while other campaign settings treat Oaths as more religious in nature. Here on Tor'Dath Oath's are rooted in ritual enchantments.  
The origin of the creation of the Oath rituals is largely unknown, but often the [Church of the Sacred Flame](/../master/Religion/Church-of-the-Sacred-Flame/church-of-the-sacred-flame.md) is followed by many paladin orders.
