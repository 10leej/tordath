# Cleric
*(Note for DMs, I allow the use of Blood Clerics from the Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting)*  
Clerics serve many roles in Tor'Dath, while they aren't always aligned with a specific organization you'll see clerics far and wide across the lands. Clerics draw their power mostly much the same way Wizards do. But, they shape their magics to follow the domains of their church. This means a cleric will never really change their domain due to devine influence and if they do they must take the time to learn the new magics.
