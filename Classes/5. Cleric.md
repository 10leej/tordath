# Cleric
Clerics serve many roles in Tor'Dath, while they aren't always aligned with a specific organization you'll see clerics far and wide across the lands.  
Clerics can draw their power from the greater dieties rather than through leylines, as well as access the magic of the leylines.  
It's recommended that a player takes the time to read the section on [Religion](/../master/Religion) but keep in mind that a cleric who follows a polytheistic religion does not necessarily have to be in the serve of a single diety.  
That said a cleric does not follow the practice of [Animism](/../master/Religion/Animism/animism.md) instead opting for the more organized religions of the [Church of the Sacred Flame](/../master/Religion/Church-of-the-Sacred-Flame/church-of-the-sacred-flame.md) or the [Circle of Nine](/../master/Religion/Circle-of-Nine).
