## The Grand Republic of Delios
Government: Republic  
Leader: Congressionally elected representatives.  
Legend says Delios was once a great nation that united all the lands of Tor'Dath. That was said to be the Kingdom of the Gods founded by Maliel himself.  
Delios does still exist as a nation, though it's much smaller and exists South of the larger Taran Empire.
