## Stroth
Government: Tribal Leadership
North of Limbul, Stroth is a rough land that is barely even recognized as a nation as it's held together by a vast network of Shamanistic Tribes. Who meet at massive festivals celebrating the seasons to discuss matters.  
There is a trading town with the same name near the south western border, but does not really act on the affairs of Stroth but more acts to keep an eye on the on goings of the land.
