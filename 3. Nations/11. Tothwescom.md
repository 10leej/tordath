## Tothwescom
Government: None Officially  
Tothwescom is an unorganized nation north of Stroth. It's comprised almost entirely of mountains and serves as the home of some sparsely populated tribes.  
Much like Stroth however, Tothwescom's closest form of government is comprised of various tribes though they seem much less likely to cooperate and focus more of their spiritual worship and survival.  
The city of Camor sits deep in the moutains far from the prying eyes of Limbuld and is the home of the Order of Storms
