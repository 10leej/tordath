# Placeholder Notes needs expansion
The nations of Limbuld, Taran, and Kor all recognize the Circle of the Nine.  
While the elven nations of Taran and the Evarian Kingdom practice a formal version of animism (think Shinto), while the nomad tribes of Stroth and the Tothwescom Mountains practice more traditional shamanism.  
The Delios recognizes the Church of the Sacred Flame, and the Eternal Night.   
Taipan Union and Bevelinar don't officially recognize any religion due to their diverse populations.  
Medbia follows the one god Dendar the Night Serpent (name might change).  
Lastly Pilto recognizes Navnas Daralath, their first king as a deity. His spirit is said to transition to each of Pilto's rulers, but it's unclear if Navnas is an actual god or if something else is happening.  

I do want to write up some ascension rules though, kinda inspired a bit from Theros.
