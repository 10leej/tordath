# Placeholder Notes needs expansion
The nations of Limbuld, Taran, and Kor all recognize the Circle of the Nine.  
While the elven nations of Taran and the Evarian Kingdom practice a formal version of animism (think Shinto), while the nomad tribes of Stroth and the Tothwescom Mountains practice more traditional shamanism.  
The Delios recognizes the Church of the Sacred Flame, and the Eternal Night.   
Taipan Union and Bevelinar don't officially recognize any religion due to their diverse populations.  
Medbia follows the one god Dendar the Night Serpent (name might change).  
Lastly Pilto recognizes Navnas Daralath the first king as a diety but it's unclear if Navnas is a god, or was a mortal.  

I do want to write up some ascension rules though, kinda inspired a bit from Theros.
