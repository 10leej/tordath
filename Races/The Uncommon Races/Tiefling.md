# Tiefling
Often mistaken the demons the Tiefling’s of Tor’Dath actually are suprisingly more related to the Yaun-Ti than humans, though no one is truly sure of the Tiefling race’s origin. It’s not so uncommon to see a Tiefling outside of Medbia or the Taran Empire, but even then it’s rare enough that many people might only ever meet a single one even among the Tiefling themselves.
