# Welcome to The World of Tor'Dath
Hi! Welcome to my creation and contribution to the wonderful world of D&D and general TTRPG games. I hope you the reader can gain some insites from my work here to establish this world and I'm very open to pull requests on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/10leej/tordath).

## The World
Tor'Dath is a world gripped by political tensions, rising cult activities, and potentially dangerous secrets. From fallen ancient kingdoms, to many various mysteries, and the thrill of discovering a new leyline. There's much to be done here.

## The Content
This campaign setting was written with the inclusion of Critical Role content, and Eberron's Artificer class. Outside of that you'll only really want the Core Rule book.  

## Running a D&D Campaign
I admit, this as is, is not a complete guide. Thats why I said you should bookmark it. As is you'll have to come up with the history of the world though I do have some general guidelines for the history laid out if you read the various segments in here. 

## Why GitHub?
Well this is largely an experiment to teach myself the wonderful tool we call git, and it fits with my feeling that there should be a fully featured and well documented Campaign Setting on the internet available for free without charge. I hope this can be a community effort so feel free to submit a pull request adding content. I know such a document isn't exactly the nature of GitHub as it's more associated with Programming but for an effort like this I don't see why I wouldn't use git.

## The License
Currently the license for The Tor'Dath Campaign setting is Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International. I do not know if this is the appropriate license or not, but I hope I could get some input here as the last thing I want is to get in some kind of trouble.

## Future Plans
As time goes on I'll be adding more and more information to this world. Be very wary as currently this is a living document (again bookmarks or Git follows are a good thing to have).

## How to Contribute
Well there's this [helpful issue](https://github.com/10leej/tordath/issues/1) that's been opened, give it a quick read.
