# Welcome to The World of Tor'Dath
Hi I'm Josh I'm writing this setting as I progress through my campaign. So I suggest you bookmark [this page](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/-m-ibxHg) and look for updates fairly often.  
If you're curious on the campaign specifics. It's a homebrew inspired by [Matt Colville's](https://www.youtube.com/user/mcolville) *Running the Game* series and as such you'll see some references.

## The World
Tor'Dath is a world gripped by political tensions, rising cult activities, and potentially dangerous secrets. From fallen ancient kingdoms, to many various mysteries, and the thrill of discovering a new leyline. There's much to be done here.

## The Content
This campaign setting was written with the inclusion of Critical Role content, and Eberron's Artificer class. Outside of that you'll only really want the Core Rule book.  
You'll also want to include optional firearm rules in the Dungeon Matser's Guide (page 267) using just the Rennaisance weapons.  
Airships do exist but are rare and require a crew of artificers to keep aloft due to their unreliability. (more details coming later)

## Running a D&D Campaign
I admit, this as is, is not a complete guide. Thats why I said you should bookmark it. As is you'll have to come up with the history of the world though I do have some general guidelines for the history laid out. I'll be updating this document with the history of the world [soon](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=soon)  

## Future Plans
As time goes on I'll be adding more and more information to this world.
