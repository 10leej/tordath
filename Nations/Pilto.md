## Pilto
Government: Kingdom  
Leader: King Corus Piltoth  
Capital: Navnadiv  

Pilto is a seafaring island nation and is home of the isolationistic Tritons and ruled by a constitutional monarchy. 

It was originally founded by the God-King Navnas Daralath, after he united the warring states of the land through a combination of conquest and displays of divine power. He brought a golden era onto Pilto, with a population boom, many technological improvements, and even colonies on the mainland. Pilto became a naval superpower on the world stage. During his rein, the vast majority of Tritons began worshiping him, though a small few held on to the old beliefs. It came to be believed that when the body of a ruler dies, the spirit of Navnas Daralath transitions to the body of the rightful heir. Thus the collective knowledge and power of Navnas Daralath builds as each generation passes. 

The golden era of Pilto is long behind them though. Infighting led to the loss of the colonies. Famines led to civil wars and the weakening of Pilto's image. In a last ditch attempt to save the kingdom, Queen Barshal Piltoth sealed the country off from the world and cracked down on sedition. Not much is known of what happened in those early days of isolation, even within Pilto. Rumors say that thousands were killed as a brutal system of control was put in place. Regardless, the monarchy was able to maintain control and re-strengthen the kingdom.

King Corus Piltoth, through the divine wisdom of Navnas Daralath, has decided it is time to start the process of joining the world stage again. It has only recently opened it's borders to outsiders. Though many curios foreigners and merchants have visited, it's rare they are allowed to leave the designated port. Even diplomatic envoys rarely make it to a city.

Though outsiders question the true divinity of Navnas Daralath and the rulers he inhabits, it is know, at least in some circles, the clerics of this religion do channel their powers through him. Some of The Mages Society believe his power comes from strange and ancient ways of harnessing leyline. Many have dedicated themselves to infiltrating the country and discovering this knowledge for themselves. Few are able to make it across the boarder and even fewer return to speak of it.

Despite their cold approach to foreigners, the people of Pilto eagerly purchase new leyline powered technology and seem to embrace a mix of traditional culture and new ideas. More Triton are seen sailing and trading with the other countries of Tor'Dath. Many see them as a curiosity, however they tend to keep to themselves on these journeys.

It is suspected by some statesman, that the acquisition of these new technologies and exploration of other countries is a harbinger of Pilto's true plans. To amass a fleet, rebuild it's colonies, and expand further. However so little information is available about Pilto, that even proponents of these theories are skeptical of them.

### Navnadiv
Named after Pilto's founder, Navnadiv is the capital of the kingdom. It is said to be a very wealthy city, sitting at a major crossroads and containing several universities and trades schools. 

The palace that monarchy resides in could be considered a city itself. It occupies a large plateau in the middle of Navnadiv and contains many servants, bureaucrats, and scholars. There are so many rooms in the palace, some are thought to have not been opened in centuries. It undoubtedly contains many riches and knowledge, though no outsider has seen it since Pilto closed it's boarders.

### Raptdiv
The port facility open to foreigners. It is the only place outsiders are allowed to dock at and is where most business with them occurs. Port officials are very strict, and not afraid to imprison or kill those who violate their rules.
