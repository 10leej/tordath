# Magic in Tor'Dath
(reference material doc, not final)
Magic in tordath stems from various sources, but the majority is from the leylines of the world, very few are mapped as they're near the surface, the few that are known have Center's of Knowledge located where they are nearest to the surface and are closely guarded by the nations that control them.

## Using Magic in Tor'Dath
- When a wizard casts a spell they're artificially weaving the energies from a nearby leyline and binding it in the scriptures of the spells in their spellbook when they prepare their spells after a long rest.  
- A sorceror is a being naturally infused from the raw power of leyline energy, either from the bloodline of an ancestor, being nearby a leyline for an extended time, or direct exposure. A sorceror's magical connection to leyline energy becomes more apparent the nearer a sorceror is to a leyline, this makes Sorceror adept and useful for helping locate leylines, if a sorceror can be found that is.  
- An artificer uses technology to store and use the leyline enegies much like a wizard does, however it is artificially bound and contained in a battery like device called a *Mythallar* rather than weaved naturally like how a wizard would.  
- A bard weaves the energies of leylines through their performances weaving spells much like how wizards would but rather than ingraining the magical energy into text, the brads weave the magic as they perform. Creating a more natural access to the powers of leyline magic than a wizard, but not as strongly as how sorcerors channels their power.
- Druids specifically use a Leyline magic to use their spells and abilities channelling it through their connection with the natural environment around them.

## Epic Magic
When players are able to be in direct access of a leyline they can perform magical spells of higher level spell slots not normally available to them. 10th level spells and above can be cast, but only as rituals. Utilizing leylines have drawbacks though, players can lose memories of their past, they can become physical frail or weaker, the spell could backfire, or if the spell is powerful enough, the player could even potentially die as well.  
Players must be level 10 and higher, players must be able to directly access a leyline, all Epic Magic spells cast have a 25% chance of failure (rolled by the DM)
When an Epic Magic spell is cast, the player/players character/characters cannot cast another Epic Magic spell for a full year. If they attempt they have a 100& chance of failure and can still suffer drawbacks.  
There's descriptions for Epic Magic spells at the end of this chapter.

## Divine magic
True clerics draw their power directly from their dieties.

## Patron Magic
Warlocks draw their powers directly from their patrons and do not use leyline magic directly, however their patron's might.

## Spirit Magic
Spirit magic is granted by the ancestors of one's past. Often the shamanistic barbarian tribes of Tothwescom and Stroth practice such magic. That said a Monk's Ki points are rooted in this magical power as well.

## Oaths
Oaths are rituals of binding using both Spirit and Divine magic. As long as the sworn tenants stand true, the one who swears by them can expect the powers promised to stand true. That said, if a tenant is broken, the Oathbreaker (DMG subclass) is infused purely with the magic of the spirits of those who have broken their Oaths in the past and are haunted by them.
