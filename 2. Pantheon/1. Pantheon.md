# Pantheon
The gods of Tor'Dath are often not referred to by their direct name, but rather they often referred to in descriptive nicknames or aliases. You'll see the most common names listed.  
The gods are distant from Tor'Dath but they don't leave the planet abandoned, instead they may go only as far as the smallest influence on the world. That said there have been times before where mortal's have ascended to godhood, or even gods have fallen.  
Malliel stands atop as the lone Head of the Pantheon while the rest serve as his advisors.
