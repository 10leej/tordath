Fighters are everywhere as a staple of Fantasy worlds you'll see fights from every race. They serve as guards, gladiators, hunters, what have you. The [Gunsligner Martial Archetype](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/170778/Gunslinger-Martial-Archetype-for-Fighters) written by Mathew Mercer is recommended though I admit I don't have a player running it.
