# Warlock
Warlocks due to how they gain their power are often shunned or even criminalized in some areas. That said with the direct absence of the gods the powers of demonic influence are made more apparent, and warlocks gain there powers through the contracts and pacts signed with fiends, celestials, or even ancient beings of great power.
