# Blood Hunter
[Blood Hunters](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/301641/Blood-Hunter-Class-for-DD-5e-2020) are usually followers of Rapha who are willing to sacrifice everything to fight their enemies. They often are not welcomed by those more practiced in the magical arts as the magic they practice is usually linked with vampirism.
