# Paladin
Paladin's on Tor'Dath do not gain their powers from gods unlike some worlds, instead their power stems from the Oaths they have taken and the ancient magics behind them. That said a paladin who takes no oath is powerless, while the Oathbreaker paladin stands as a paladin who has broken an aspect of his oath. Over the course of a paladin's life it's not unusual for his powers to change based upon the oaths he has taken.
