Tor'Dath is on the very beginning stages of a sort of industrial revolution. With the invention of the *Mythallar* vehicles such as airships and trains exist. I've taken a fair bit of inspiration from [Planeshoft: Kaladesh](https://media.wizards.com/2017/downloads/magic/Plane-Shift_Kaladesh.pdf) in how Leyline magic is channel more or less like Aether, however the grand explosion of technology hasn't quite happenned yet here. That said if you planning a steampunk futuristic syle setting, feel free to use this setting.  
Cities like Vass, and like the Free cities of Bevlinar are farther advanced in technology compared to the rest fo the world.
