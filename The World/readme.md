# Welcome to The World of Tor'Dath
Hi I'm Josh I'm writing this setting as I progress through my campaign. So I suggest you bookmark [this page](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/-m-ibxHg) and look for updates fairly often.  
If you're curious on the campaign specifics. It's a homebrew inspired by [Matt Colville's](https://www.youtube.com/user/mcolville) *Running the Game* series and as such you'll see some references.

## The World
Tor'Dath is a world gripped by political tensions, rising cult activities, and potentially dangerous secrets. From fallen ancient kingdoms, to many various mysteries I personally hope whoever decides to run this setting has much fun as I do.  
This guide as is, is fairly minimal and that is because Tor'Dath is a player driven world. As such you won't find a single map here (yet), nor a lot of detail in general. As such its a great base for a DM who wan't to homebrew a new setting and modify it to his/her hearts contempt.

## The Content
This campaign setting was written with the inclusion of Critical Role content, and Eberron's Artificer class. Outside of that you'll want the Core Rule books, and Volo's Guide to Monsters.  
You'll also want to include optional firearm rules in the Dungeon Matser's Guide (page 267) using just the Rennaisance weapons.  
Airships do exist but are rare and require a crew of artificers to keep aloft due to their unreliability. (more details coming later)

## Running a D&D Campaign
I admit, this as is, is not a complete guide. Thats why I said you should bookmark it. As is you'll have to come up with the history of the world though I do have some general guidelines for the history laid out. I'll be updating this document with the history of the world [soon](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=soon)  

## Future Plans
Eventually I'll release a more detailed version and possibly some optional class options specific to the Tor'Dath Campaign Setting. I might even publish some of the adventures I plan to run out of here, who knows.
Working on more right now
